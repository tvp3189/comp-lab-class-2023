# Assignment for Week 3

Do the Lysozyme tutorial for Gromacs on HPC, adapting as needed
http://www.mdtutorials.com/gmx/lysozyme/index.html

Instead of using the file names in the tutorial, try to give good file names rather than just e.g. em.gro

At the end, run a 50 ns MD simulation, and then make a trajectory and gro file without water with the molecule wrapped in the box (check in VMD)

Make all the plots in the tutorial within a Jupyter notebook.

Organize your results as follows
- Input: Put the inputs from the tutorial here in an organized way
- Setup: Put the setup steps of your work here
- Data: Put your 50ns trajectory without water here. Also put all the files you would need to run again here.
- Analysis: Put jupyter notebooks for analyzing the trajectory here
- Figures: Save you figures here
